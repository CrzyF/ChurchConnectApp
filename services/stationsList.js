            message: "Jesus, you stand all alone before Pilate. Nobody speaks up for you. Nobody helps defend you. You devoted your entire life to helping others, listening to the smallest ones, caring for those who were ignored by others.

They don't seem to remember that as they prepare to put you to death.\n\nAs a child, sometimes I feel alone. Sometimes I feel that others don't stand up for me and defend me when I am afraid. Sometimes I don't feel like I am treated fairly, especially if I am scolded or corrected.\n\nAs an adult, sometimes I feel abandoned and afraid as well. Sometimes I too, feel like I am treated unfairly or blamed for things unfairly. I have a hard time when people criticize me at home or at work.\n\nHelp me be grateful for what you did for me. Help me to accept criticism and unfairness as you did, and not complain. Help me pray for those who have hurt me.\n\nMy Jesus, often have I signed the death warrant by my sins; save me by Thy death from that eternal death which I have so often deserved.\n\nOur Father.... Hail Mary.... Glory Be to the Father....\n\nLeader: Jesus Christ Crucified.\n\nAll: Have mercy on Us.\n\nLeader: May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, Rest in peace.\n\nAll: Amen."

You knew it wouldn't be easy, but you accepted it and carried it just the same.\n\nAs a child, sometimes I don't like the problems that come my way. Sometimes I try to get others to take care of them or solve them for me. Sometimes I become upset and crabby when I'm asked to do even the smallest thing to help others.\n\nAs an adult I sometimes feel like I'm not appreciated. Sometimes I feel as if I accept more responsibility that I need to. I can feel sorry for myself, even though the crosses others carry are much larger than my own. In my self-pity, I don't reach out to help.\n\nMy Jesus, Who by Thine own will didst take on Thee the most heavy cross I made for Thee by my sins, oh, make me feel their heavy weight, and weep for them ever while I live.\n\nOur Father....

I hurry to get finished and sometimes don't do my work well. Sometimes I don't pay attention to what I should be doing. When things get hard for me, sometimes I give up.\n\nAs an adult, I sometimes put things off. I give up too easily, and sometimes don't do my work as well as I know I can.\n\nMy Jesus, the heavy burden of my sins is on Thee, and bears Thee down beneath the cross.

She does understand and care.\n\nAs a child, sometimes I feel like too many things are going on. Sometimes other kids pick on me and call me names. I need to look around me for a friendly face, and for the help I need. I need to share my troubles with those who truly care about me.\n\nAs an adult I sometimes feel overwhelmed by many things. Life is so competitive, and I worry so much about my future and those who have some control over it. I need to remember that being an adult does not mean having to solve every problem all by myself. I need to look around me for a friendly face, for the help I need.\n\nJesus most suffering, Mary Mother most sorrowful, if, by my sins, I caused you pain and anguish in the past, by God's assisting grace it shall be so no more; rather be you my love henceforth till death.\n\nOur Father....

Blest too shall I be if I aid Thee to bear the cross, by patiently bowing my neck to the crosses Thou shalt send me during life. My Jesus, give me grace to do so.\n\nOur Father.... Hail Mary....

They may be picked on or teased by others, or just sad or lonely. Sometimes I feel bad that others don't step in to help, but I don't help either.\n\nAs an adult, I notice the needs around me. Sometimes my own family members crave my attention, and I don't even seem to notice.

It is easy to despair over small things, and sometimes I do.\n\nHelp me when things seem difficult for me. Even when it's hard, help me get up and keep trying as you did. Help me do my best without comparing myself with others.\n\nMy Jesus, often have I sinned and often, by sin, beaten Thee to the ground beneath the cross. Help me to use the efficacious means of grace that I may never fall again.\n\nOur Father.... Hail Mary....

I think about what I want and would like people to spend their lives pleasing me.\n\nAs an adult, sometimes I act like a child.

I find it hard to get along with my sisters and brothers, sometimes I'm not honest, sometimes I'm lazy. I'm tempted to stop trying. It's just too hard sometimes.\n\nAs an adult, I often feel I should have conquered my weaknesses by now. I become discouraged when I'm confronted by the same problems over and over again.
